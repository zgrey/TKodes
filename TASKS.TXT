Zach/Thurston:

- Review SEIR modeling and determine how the existing graphs (e.g., the drivetrain graph)
can be used to inform and initialize an SEIR model
	- How do we interpret Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infectious (I), Hospitalized (H), and various Removals (R's)
	in the drivetrain example?
	- What is the quantity of interest as an output? (e.g., R_0 reproduction number)
	- What are the nonminal parameter values so that we can perturb these values?

- Given Thurston's "learned" graph network, let's model the associated dynamics
	- Does SEIR even make sense?
	- Let's tabulate alternatives
